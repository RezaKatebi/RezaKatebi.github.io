        <p>
            Currently I am a Senior AI Engineer working on vision at Tesla. I got my PhD in Astrophysics from Ohio University.
            There, I worked on Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and the behaviour of the accretion disk around 
            the Super Massive Black Holes at their center. I have also worked on utilizing machine learning in astronomy.
            Before that, I worked with SXS collaboration on simulating binary black hole mergers with extremal spins 
            and gravitational waves emitted from them. Recently, I have also started to work on Machine Learning and 
            Deep Learning both as side projects because I am very interested in them and also their usage in astronomy.
