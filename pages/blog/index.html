        <p>Consciousness is like a miracle popping out of an old jar. We humans take it for granted. We are self-conscious:
            "we think therefore we are". But wait, where does that thinking come from?
            Where does that sentence come from? Or even better, where does the "I" that makes up this "we" come from? Are we
            born with this sense of "I"? </p>
