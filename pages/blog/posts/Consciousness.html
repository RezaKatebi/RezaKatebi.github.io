    <h1>Consciousness in the Age of Distraction</h1>
    <div class="blog-post-date">August 20, 2023</div>

    <p><strong>Warning:</strong> This essay is written after drinking some whiskey and delving into philosophy. I call
        it a spatter of nonsense that might actually make sense.</p>

    <p>Consciousness is like a miracle popping out of an old jar. We humans take it for granted. We are self-conscious:
        "we think therefore we are". But wait, where does that thinking come from? Where does that sentence come from?
        Or even better, where does the "I" that makes up this "we" come from? Are we born with this sense of "I"?</p>

    <p>In our age of commercials, superhero movies, and social media, these questions are often swept under the rug.
        Why, you may ask? Profit is my answer. What will happen if we turn the lens of this mysterious "I" back on
        itself? We may never know where it comes from, but we certainly don't want it lost in the ever-noisy information
        age. Each "I" is unique. It is the sum of all experiences, feedback from the ever-changing environment, achieved
        desires, rewards, punishments, successes, failures, braveries, and fears. Whether it's an illusion or not, this
        "I" is the entity in control.</p>

    <p>In the information age, this "I" is being overshadowed by the noise of the masses. How? By the attention
        industry, of course. You are not truly yourself if you do not self-reflect. Yet, what we mostly see is the
        constant checking of phones, the abuse of social acceptance, all for a few more pennies of profit. How much of
        our time will be lost before we realize that we are made up of collective "I"s?</p>

    <p>This situation didn't necessarily start this way, or perhaps it did. It doesn't matter for our argument here. The
        only thing that makes us human is the self-consciousness we possess. The unique "I" formed by our genuine,
        varied experiences. What makes your "I" and my "I" unique is that each of us has different desires, dreams,
        fears, and ideas. Now, the realm of social media, the attention market, and the misuse of social approval are
        creating a virtual environment that confines these human experiences to a limited set defined by a handful of
        engineers in Silicon Valley.</p>

    <p>Our attention is up for grabs, auctioned to the highest bidder. What does our attention represent? The feedback
        that shapes our "I"s. Hopefully, you see where I'm going with this. Our identity is being reformed to pad the
        wallets of a select few. The repercussions of this diminished self-awareness are grave: increasing suicides,
        pervasive unhappiness, needless social comparison, loss of attention and focus, addiction to social media, and
        immersion in a fantasy world, losing touch with reality. George Orwell's "1984" isn't necessarily about Big
        Brother. It could be something as seemingly benign as the engineered attention business, limited by the
        experiences of a few. When the spectrum of experience diminishes, consciousness—the essence of "I"ness—suffers,
        and an Orwellian world emerges.</p>

    <p>Time and again, I've observed people feeling lost when their phones die. I remember a time when I was a child,
        and neither phones nor the internet were available to the general populace. As a kid, I never felt boredom.
        There was always something captivating in the world around me. For hours on end, I could lose myself in books.
        Once, boredom was the wellspring of creativity. Now, solitude with one's thoughts is nearly foreign to newer
        generations. Recall that what makes us unique is the power of self-reflection. Some might say I'm being
        melodramatic. But am I? Don't you think the long-term threats are more significant than we imagine?</p>

    <p>Our core "I", the essence of our identity, is under manipulation. Some might argue it's controllable, but I
        believe the gravity isn't fully grasped, and until it's recognized as a real addiction or syndrome, it won't be
        taken earnestly.</p>

    <p>It's not just a group of engineers trying to connect humanity globally with dreams of heightened worldwide
        empathy. If you believe this, I reckon you're living under a rather sizable, illusionary rock. When billions are
        spent hiring behavioral psychologists to tweak our behavior, ensuring we're hooked on using social media
        services more, viewing their content more often, and thereby taking precious moments from our lives, it becomes
        an assault on our very being. Each second we invest in these profit-oriented machines (and not to our benefit,
        mind you) is irrevocably lost.</p>

    <p>We must remember our mortality. We're afforded a finite amount of time on this planet. While these services seem
        free, they exact a toll: our time. Can we attach a value to human life—in seconds, minutes, or hours? The outcry
        would be a resounding no. But in reality, isn't that their business model? In a movie, it would be a heinous act
        if subjects were forced to view the world through a narrow lens, their realities tailored by a select few to
        optimize others' profits. Yet, this is transpiring in our world, with our life hours auctioned for gain, and
        it's all perfectly legal. Surprised?</p>

    <p>To encapsulate my thoughts, I'll borrow from Thoreau: "I do not so much wish to know how to economize time as how
        to spend it, by what means to grow rich, that the day may not have been in vain."</p>
