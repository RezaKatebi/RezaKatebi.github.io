# Bio
My name is Reza Katebi. I am an Astrophysics PhD student in department of physics
and astronomy at Ohio University. Here, I have been working on Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and the behaviour of the accretion disk around the Super Massive Black Holes at their center. Before coming here, I worked with SXS collaboration on simulating binary black hole mergers with extremal spins and gravitational waves emitted from them. Recently, I have also started to work on Machine Learning and Deep Learning both as side projects because I am very interested in them and also their usage in astronomy.
