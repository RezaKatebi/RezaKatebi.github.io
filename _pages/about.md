# Bio
My name is Reza Katebi. I am an Astrophysics PhD student in department of physics and astronomy at Ohio University. After coming here, I have been working on Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and the behaviour of the accretion disk around the Super Massive Black Holes at their center. Before coming here, I worked with SXS collaboration on simulating binary black hole mergers with extremal spins and gravitational waves emitted from them. I have also been working on Machine Learning and Deep Learning for past 2 years and I am very passionate about them and their practical usage.
